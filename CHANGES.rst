==================

.. note::

==================

.. note::
    The ASDF Standard is at v1.3.0

- Storage of arbitrary precision integers is now provided by
  ``asdf.IntegerType``.  Reading a file with integer literals that are too
  large now causes only a warning instead of a validation error. This is to
  provide backwards compatibility for files that were created with a buggy
  version of ASDF (see #553 below). [`#566 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/566>`_]

- Remove WCS tags. These are now provided by the `gwcs package

2.2.0 (2018-11-14)
==================

- Add new parameter ``lazy_load`` to ``AsdfFile.open``. It is ``True`` by
  default and preserves the default behavior. ``False`` detaches the
  loaded tree from the underlying file: all blocks are fully read and
  numpy arrays are materialized. Thus it becomes safe to close the file
  and continue using ``AsdfFile.tree``. However, ``copy_arrays`` parameter
  is still effective and the active memory maps may still require the file
  to stay open in case ``copy_arrays`` is ``False``. [`#573 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/573>`_]

- Add ``AsdfConversionWarning`` for failures to convert ASDF tree into custom
  types. This warning is converted to an error when using
  ``assert_roundtrip_tree`` for tests. [`#583 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/583>`_]

- Deprecate ``asdf.AsdfFile.open`` in favor of ``asdf.open``. [`#579 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/579>`_]

  index before any others. This fixes a bug that was related to the way that
  subclass tags were overwritten by external extensions. [`#598 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/598>`_]

2.1.1 (2018-11-01)

  on-the-fly. [`#549 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/549>`_]

- Fix large integer validation when storing `numpy` integer literals in the
  tree. [`#553 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/553>`_]

  tag. [`#560 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/560>`_]

- Fix bug that occurred when attempting to open invalid file but Astropy import
  fails while checking for ASDF-in-FITS. [`#562 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/562>`_]

- Fix bug that caused tree creation to fail when unable to locate a schema file
  for an unknown tag. This now simply causes a warning, and the offending node
  is converted to basic Python data structures. [`#571 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/571>`_]

2.1.0 (2018-09-25)
==================

- Add API function for retrieving history entries. [`#501 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/501>`_]

- Store ASDF-in-FITS data inside a 1x1 BINTABLE HDU. [`#519 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/519>`_]

- Fix bug that prevented use of ASDF-in-FITS with HDUs that have names with
  underscores. [`#543 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/543>`_]

==================

- Update test infrastructure to rely on new Astropy v3.0 plugins. [`#461 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/461>`_]

- Disable use of 2to3. This was causing test failures on Debian builds. [`#463 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/463>`_]

==================

- Fixed a bug in reading data from an "http:" url. [`#231 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/231>`_]

- Implements v 1.1.0 of the asdf schemas. [`#233 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/233>`_]

- Added a function ``is_asdf_file`` which inspects the input and
  returns ``True`` or ``False``. [`#239 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/239>`_]

- The ``open`` method of ``AsdfInFits`` now accepts URIs and open file handles
  in addition to HDULists. The ``open`` method of ``AsdfFile`` will now try to
  parse the given URI or file handle as ``AsdfInFits`` if it is not obviously a
  regular ASDF file. [`#241 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/241>`_]

- Updated WCS frame fields ``obsgeoloc`` and ``obsgeovel`` to reflect recent
  updates in ``astropy`` that changed representation from ``Quantity`` to
  ``CartesianRepresentation``. Updated to reflect ``astropy`` change that
  combines ``galcen_ra`` and ``galcen_dec`` into ``galcen_coord``. Added
  support for new field ``galcen_v_sun``. Added support for required module
  versions for tag classes. [`#244 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/244>`_]

- Added support for ``lz4`` compression algorithm [`#258 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/258>`_]. Also added support
  for using a different compression algorithm for writing out a file than the
  one that was used for reading the file (e.g. to convert blocks to use a
  different compression algorithm) [`#257 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/257>`_]

- Tag classes may now use an optional ``supported_versions`` attribute to
  declare exclusive support for particular versions of the corresponding
  schema. If this attribute is omitted (as it is for most existing tag
  classes), the tag is assumed to be compatible with all versions of the
  corresponding schema. If ``supported_versions`` is provided, the tag class
  implementation can include code that is conditioned on the schema version. If
  an incompatible schema is encountered, or if deserialization of the tagged
  object fails with an exception, a raw Python data structure will be returned.
  [`#272 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/272>`_]

- Added option to ``AsdfFile.open`` to allow suppression of warning messages
  when mismatched schema versions are encountered. [`#294 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/294>`_]

- Added a diff tool to ``asdftool`` to allow for visual comparison of pairs of
  ASDF files. [`#286 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/286>`_]

- Added command to ``asdftool`` to display available tags. [`#303 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/303>`_]

- When possible, display name of ASDF file that caused version mismatch
  warning. [`#306 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/306>`_]

- Issue a warning when an unrecognized tag is encountered. [`#295 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/295>`_] This warning
  is silenced by default, but can be enabled with a parameter to the
  ``AsdfFile`` constructor, or to ``AsdfFile.open``. Also added an option for
  ignoring warnings from unrecognized schema tags. [`#319 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/319>`_]

- Fix bug with loading JSON schemas in Python 3.5. [`#317 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/317>`_]

- Remove all remnants of support for Python 2.6. [`#333 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/333>`_]

- Fix issues with the type index used for writing out ASDF files. This ensures
  that items in the type index are not inadvertently overwritten by later
  versions of the same type. It also makes sure that schema example tests run
  against the correct version of the ASDF standard. [`#350 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/350>`_]

- Update time schema to reflect changes in astropy. This fixes an outstanding
  bug. [`#343 <https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf/issues/343>`_]
