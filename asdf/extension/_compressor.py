"""
Compressor is an interface to implement extensions to the compression
module. Extensions will typically subclass the Compressor ABC and
provide that subclass as a setuptools entry point.

Note that this interface has similar patterns to Converter.  This
interface is designed for compression and decompression of ASDF
binary array blocks, while Converter is designed for serialization
of custom Python types into the YAML tree.
