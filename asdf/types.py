        types to be properly serialized without having to write an entirely

        This feature can only be used for tagged types where the underlying
        YAML representation of the type is an object (i.e. a Python `dict`). It

        The subclass metadata is stored in a new attribute of the YAML node. By
        default the attribute name is "subclass", but it is customizable by
        using the optional `attribute` keyword argument of the decorator.

        The schema of the base custom type is used for validation. This feature
        will not work if the base schema disallows additional attributes.

        It is incumbent upon the user to avoid name conflicts with attributes
        that already exist in the representation of the base custom class. For
