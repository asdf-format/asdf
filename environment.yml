    # Optional dependencies: it's not necessary to install gwcs for testing
    # but it may be useful. Note that gwcs will cause a stable version of ASDF
    # to be installed as well. Unfortunately there's not a good way to express
    # --no-deps in this file (which actually seems to be a limitation of pip
    # itself, not conda).
